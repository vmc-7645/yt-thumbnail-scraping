# yt-thumbnail-scraping
Pull YouTube thumbnails (and other content) from their API and through scraping techniques

## Purpose

YouTube's API is frankly awful in my humble opinion.

This repository helps with at least the thumbnail aspect of it.

## Usage

Place your YT api key in a file title `api.key`
